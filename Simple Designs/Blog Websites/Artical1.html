                        At the beginning of your programming journey, you will discover that there are many programming languages to learn. During this process, you will frequently encounter two important terms: "syntax" and "semantics." These two concepts form the core of any programming language, and understanding them correctly is essential for progressing effectively in learning to code. In this article, we will explore the difference between "syntax" and "semantics" and highlight their importance in programming languages.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class = "artical-subtitle">Syntax</h3>
                    <p>
                        When writing code, there is a specific set of words that must follow a certain order to ensure the code is valid. This is where syntax comes into play, which is a set of rules and guidelines that dictate how to write statements in a programming language. It ensures that the statements follow the rules regarding the words used, their arrangement, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <span>Let's take the following sentence as an example:</span>
                    <br>
                    <q>Ate today apple went school.</q>
                    <br>
                    <span>This sentence is syntactically invalid because the order is illogical, and some words are missing. If we fix it, we get:</span>
                    <br>
                    <q>I ate an apple today before going to school.</q>
                    <br>
                    <span>In this corrected sentence, the order is correct, and the syntax follows proper grammatical rules.</span>
                    <h3 class = "artical-subtitle">Key aspects of syntax:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Grammar rules: Syntax involves formal grammar rules that define the order of elements in code and their hierarchical relationship.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keywords and symbols: Programming languages use specific keywords and symbols that must be used correctly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class = "artical-subtitle">Semantics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Semantics focuses on the meaning and logic of code. Even when syntax is valid, the semantics determine whether the code’s behavior is meaningful and logical. Semantics determines what the statement means, what actions it will perform, and the order in which the statement will be executed. It deals with understanding the statements to achieve the desired result.
                    </p>
                    <span>Let's consider the following sentence:</span>
                    <br>
                    <q>Sameer is a single married man.</q>

                    <p>
                        I am a person who have a keen interest and highly ambitious about technology, I have started my journey in technology with one goal in mind to make a difference and to excel, throughout my journey, I started from scratch and continuously improved myself by learning new things. I combined theoretical knowledge with practical experience to advance further.
                        During my journey, I adopted various methods to learn and improve, including self-learning, reading books, and working on projects. I pursued a bachelor's degree and took courses on subjects such as QA, system design, and more to enhance my skills.
